### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated developer that has already worked on many projects.

So my skills cover many topics and I have worked with various technologies in the past. Here are some examples...

* Kotlin development for android and API (my main and best language)
* AI development (using stable baselines and pytorch)
* CI/CD development (shell scripts)
* Game development (Mainly minecraft modding)
* C# for desktops (.NET Framework and Core) and mobiles (Xamarin.Forms)
* Android/Linux kernel development (released as open source kernel and provided on XDA forums)
