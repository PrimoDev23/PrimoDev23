### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated developer working on different projects
So my skills cover many topics and languages.

Here is a basic list of things I do or did in the past:

* Android/Linux Kernel development
* Simple shell scripts to simplify builds of kernels
* Game development (Minecraft clients)
* C# Desktop Solutions (primarily while apprenticeship and not private)
* C#/Xamarin.Forms mobile development
* Kotlin android development
* Java applications (exercises in school)
